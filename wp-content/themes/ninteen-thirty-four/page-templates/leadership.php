        <h4>UniCabinet</h4>
        <p>
          Even after 83 years, we’re never done improving. This year, we will be starting training earlier and giving students more resources and opportunities to learn and fundraise. UCLA UniCamp will be led by UniCabinet — a new student leadership group that will give students the space and support to envision the future of the UCLA UniCamp programs and turn it into a reality.
        </p>

    <h2>Session Program Director</h2>
    <p>Each session is led by a Session Program Director. SPDs will recruit Head Counselors to be part of their team. Since SPDs and HCs will already be part of their own session, they are not eligible to be a Classic Camp/OCP volunteer or be part of UniCabinet.</p>
    <p>The interview process for Session Program Director applicants is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Online application (<a href='#spd'>Apply here!</a>)</li>
      <li>Initial interviews</li>
      <li>Acceptance as an SPD candidate</li>
      <li>Summer/Fall Leadership Training</li>
      <li>Development of a camp program that includes a partner, funding, leadership team, and campers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once accepted as an SPD Candidate, you'll be part of Leadership Training and will be working with UniCabinet, professional staff, and alumni (through the Program Advisory Board) to bring your initiative from idea to reality. For some initiatives, this process can take more than one year.</p>
    <p>
      Head Counselor applications will be online in a few weeks.

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class='row'>
      <div class='medium-6 columns'>
        <p>
          <strong>Can I be a camp counselor and a UniCabinet member?</strong>
          <br />
          Yes! We think it’s valuable for all volunteers in UniCamp to interact with campers. UniCabinet members are encouraged to also be classic camp volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why is UniCabinet only open to current UCLA students?</strong>
          UCLA UniCamp is the official charity of the students of UCLA. As a student group, one of its primary missions is to give students the opportunity to grow, serve, and lead. Alumni and other Woodseys who don’t attend UCLA can still serve important roles elsewhere in the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What if I can’t make it to leadership training?</strong>
          Leadership training (September 18-22 and the weekend before/after) is an important part of becoming part of becoming an SPD or UniCabinet member. We will help you find transportation and housing in Westwood during the training. If you absolutely cannot make it, let us know on your application and we’ll reach out and try to work something out on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='medium-6 columns'>
        <p>
          <strong>Does this mean training meetings every week for the whole year!?</strong>
          Nope! A big motivation behind these changes is to spread out training rather than concentrate it in one intense quarter. Volunteers will likely be asked to attend events roughly every 2-3 weeks throughout the year rather than once or twice a week for one quarter. We know life can get hectic throughout the quarter, so UniCabinet will be working on ways to make the time commitment easier for volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What if I have suggestions or questions?</strong>
          Please email the Program Advisory Board at <a href='mailto:pab@unicamp.org'>pab@unicamp.org</a> &mdash; we’d love to hear your feedback!
