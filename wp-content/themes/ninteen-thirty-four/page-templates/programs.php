    <h2>Classic UniCamp</h2>
    <p class='explainer'>Classic UniCamp serves campers ages 10 - 14 and is our most traditional residential camp program. Campers have the opportunity to explore the outdoors and participate in traditional camp programs such as: archery, arts &amp; crafts, or rec. and also have the chance to push themselves with programs such as: the alpine climbing tower, sailing, or mountain biking.</p>

Throughout each camp session there will be special programs to address that week’s initiative.</p>

          This session is centered around anti-bullying and teaches campers to build self-esteem and restore self-confidence. Our mission statement is: "Sometimes when you hear others' critiques, it helps to know that you're just unique. What makes you different makes you special. Believing in ourselves and others will make us successful. Because pulling someone down will never help you reach the top, so be a friend and we can teach the mountain top."
