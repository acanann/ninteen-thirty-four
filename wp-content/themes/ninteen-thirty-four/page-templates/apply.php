    <h2>The Village Session</h2>
    <p>This session of camp is focused on empowering African American campers to achieve both academically and holistically by providing a platform to take ownership of their identity, legacy, and community.</p>
    <p>This week of camp will serve as a culmination of the efforts of TVNâ€™s efforts throughout the school year and will be lead by a group of compassionate, open-minded and close-knit volunteers and campers who are passionate about creating a safe space together: to get to know one another, recognize the leader within themselves and have an open dialogue about shaping our community. Campers also have the opportunity to have fun and be themselves through traditional camp activities such as archery, swimming, climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and much more.</p>
