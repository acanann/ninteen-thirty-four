    <h5>Extend your UCLA Orientation</h5>
    <p>Come to Camp River Glen, the home of the official charity of the students of UCLA. Leave from UCLA to embark on a three-day adventure where you'll get to know other incoming students. Spend some time in the mountains learning about who you are and who you might want to be. Planned and run by current students, the program will allow you to experience all of our camp activities while learning about the True Bruin Values of Respect, Accountability, Integrity, Service, and Excellence.</p>
    <p>Learn about <em>you</em>. What impact do you want to make over the next four years? What are your goals? Get an early start on fulfilling your UCLA dreams by meeting diverse but like-minded individuals who want to make a change.</p>
    <h5>Sessions</h5>
    <p>There are three True Bruin Camp sessions during the 2018 summer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>July 11-13</strong> <a href='https://apply.unicamp.org/login/register/tbc18.1'>(register)</a> — after orientation session 101.</li>
