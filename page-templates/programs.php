    <h2>Classic UniCamp</h2>
    <p class='explainer'>Classic UniCamp serves campers ages 10-14 and is our most traditional residential camp program. Campers have the opportunity to explore the outdoors and participate in traditional camp programs such as: archery, arts &amp; crafts, or rec. and also have the chance to push themselves with programs such as: the alpine climbing tower, sailing, or mountain biking.</p>
    <p class='explainer'>In addition to the traditional camp experience, each Classic UniCamp session partners with a Los Angeles area nonprofit or after-school program to address a specific social initiative. Throughout each camp session there will be special programs to address that week's initiative.</p>

        Our campers learn about the fundamentals and safety of rock climbing as a platform to experience self-growth. It focuses around the 5 pillars of rock climbing to teach campers responsibility, trust, and mindfulness. Along with learning how to climb, campers will exercise new skills in leadership and communication as they teach the basics of climbing to younger campers at the Alpine Tower. The C.L.I.M.B. program culminates with an off-site, outdoor climb which allows them to fully appreciate and utilize everything they have learned through the program.
