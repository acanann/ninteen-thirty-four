    <h2>Classic UniCamp</h2>
    <p class='explainer'>Classic UniCamp serves campers ages 10 - 14 and is our most traditional residential camp program. Campers have the opportunity to explore the outdoors and participate in traditional camp programs such as: archery, arts &amp; crafts, or rec. and also have the chance to push themselves with programs such as: the alpine climbing tower, sailing, or mountain biking.</p>
    <p class='explainer'>In addition to the traditional camp experience, each Classic UniCamp session partners with a Los Angeles area nonprofit or after-school program to address a specific social initiative. Throughout each camp session there will be special programs to address that week’s initiative.</p>

    <h2>Initiave Sessions</h2>
    <p class='explainer'>In 2011 UCLA UniCamp began partnering with local nonprofits and after school programs to expand UniCamp’s impact beyond a week over the summer. By working with other agencies UCLA UniCamp has been able to see how we impact our campers beyond the week of camp as agencies relay the impact they see in the campers throughout the year.</p>

This session plans to combine and develop the students’ socio-emotional learning skills with new strategies to promote healthy minds. Through education of mental health, session one aims to provide resources to these students that will allow them to successfully transition from high school to college. Session one is working with a variety of on-campus organizations at UCLA that focus on mental health, enabling them to better train their volunteers and create better outcome based programming for their kids.
